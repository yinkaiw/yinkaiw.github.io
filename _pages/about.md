Yinkai Wang is a senior student major in  Computer Science at George Mason University. He has interests in multilingual Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and CV. He works on Named Entity Recognition, Protein Structure Prediction, Molecule Generation and Educational Data Mining. He worked with [Dr. Antonios Anastasopoulos](https://cs.gmu.edu/~antonis/author/antonios-anastasopoulos/), [Dr. Liang Zhao](http://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/), [Dr. Amarda Shehu](https://cs.gmu.edu/~ashehu/?q=People). He participated in CCI as scholar with [Dr. Daniel Barbará](https://care.gmu.edu/barbara/). He act as intern in Peking University VDIG lab with [Dr. Yongtao Wang](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81486645230). Also, he works in JD.com on Text Generation with [Dr. Lingfei Wu](https://sites.google.com/a/email.wm.edu/teddy-lfwu/) and [Dr. Xiaojie Guo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaojie-Guo-3).
