Yinkai Wang is a PhD student at Tufts University. He works on Protein Structure Prediction, Molecule Generation, Named Entity Recognition, and Educational Data Mining. His advisor is [Dr. Soha Hassoun](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~soha/). He worked with [Dr. Antonios Anastasopoulos](https://cs.gmu.edu/~antonis/author/antonios-anastasopoulos/), [Dr. Liang Zhao](http://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/), [Dr. Amarda Shehu](https://cs.gmu.edu/~ashehu/?q=People). He participated in CCI as scholar with [Dr. Daniel Barbará](https://care.gmu.edu/barbara/). He act as intern in Peking University VDIG lab with [Dr. Yongtao Wang](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81486645230). Also, he works in JD.com on Text Generation with [Dr. Lingfei Wu](https://sites.google.com/a/email.wm.edu/teddy-lfwu/) and [Dr. Xiaojie Guo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaojie-Guo-3).
